# monopoly_R
Scripts I've written in R that either mathematically play or analyze the classic game Monopoly.

Currently there are two scripts in this repository.

1. play_monopoly.R
  This script pretends that you are playing Monopoly by yourself and rolling the dice n number of times.
  The goal of this script is to understand what spaces a player is most likely to land on.
  The script prints out a graph showing which spaces you landed on the most and least during n rolls of the dice.

2. monopoly_property_cost_benefit_analysis.R
  This script incorporates the total cost of a property / 4 houses / 1 hotel and compares it to the possible rent recieved to find which properties are the most profitable.
  The script prints out a graph showing which properties are most profitable.
